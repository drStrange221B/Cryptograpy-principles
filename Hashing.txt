Hash functions: 

OpenSSL command Line: free set of cryptographic tools 

steps to update the software in several nodes
1) Install or upgrade LibreSSL
2) Navigate the help
3) compute the hash of a file

Step 1 ( Install or update LibreSSL)
mac => terminal
windows => WSL 2 - Windows subsystem for Linux 
Linux => bash shell

Commands
OpenSSL -h => get all the help
openssl version => check the version of OpenSSL
brew install libressl => upgrade


Step 2 ( download file that needs to be install )
1) download from the sourece, check the hash eg ( asc, sha512) by clicking the hash.
2) use OpenSSL command line to compute the Hash of download
- terminal command
   $ openssl -h => to check the sub commnad to check how to compute the digest of the file
   $ man openssl => check the manul for all the OpenSSL command
   $ /^dgst => dgst is the sub command, this will give more detail on sub command dgst
   $ q => to exit the manul
   
   check the digest command use the one at the download Hash
   $ cat ~/Download/<filename> | openssl digst -sha512 
   
now compare the value shown on the website. if the value is same then the download file has not been tampred with. 

Collision Resistance: A strong hash function make harder for an attacker to find second file that produces same hash as the original.
this property is known as Collision Resistance.
